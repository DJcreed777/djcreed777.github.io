        <h1>Prototype Game Wiki</h1>
        <p>As I mentioned in the discussion I will try to make this into a walkthrough site for a game. But since It will be just one page, I will only make it the bare minimum of a beginners guide to a game.</p>
        <h2>Beginners Guide</h2>
        <p>I will start talking about what to watch out for and tips that you'll want to know early here. Once I know how to make boxs I will but the first steps into them. After that I will have the Tips that are helpful but you don't necessarily need to know below it.</p>
        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>The game I will be using is most likely an RPG so I will be adding the starting classes with their equipment and stats in a graph and/or list</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example Class</li>
            <li>Example Class</li>
            <li>Example Class</li>
